# dropspace NFT Contract

## Supported operating systems

**Linux**<br>
The building and the test passing is fully supported & checked by CI.

**macOS**<br>
The building and the test passing should work, but the workspace doesn't support the node downloading by `cargo xtask`. Not checked by CI.

**Windows**<br>
Not supported.

## Usage

The workspace consists of mainly contracts & a few libraries. Some of them have a clickable title in `README.md`, this means they have an article on [Gear Wiki](https://wiki.gear-tech.io).

Above the title, there are clickable badges:
- <picture><img alt="Open in Gitpod" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Open_in-Gitpod-white?logo=gitpod"></picture> opens a Gitpod workspace in your browser with the set up environment to play with code.
- <picture><img alt="Docs" src="https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/gear-foundation/dapps/contracts.yml?logo=rust&label=docs"></picture> opens the portal with generated documentation from the workspace.<br>
Note that it's built from the latest commit on the `master` branch. Therefore, when using the stable pre-built binaries, it's better to refer to the documentation from the corresponding stable release commit.

cargo b
```

### ‚úÖ Build & run tests
